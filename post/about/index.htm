  <h2>Peer-to-peer networking with browsers</h2>

  <p>
  P allows you to establish direct browser-to-browser connections. With P, you can:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Establish connections to other browsers using a WebSocket server.</li>
    <li>Establish connections to other browsers using connections you've established to other browsers.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    After a connection is established the middleman is no longer nescessary &ndash; 
    no proxies are involved.
  </p>

  <p>
    This is made possible by an unstable and young technology -- <a href="http://www.webrtc.org/">WebRTC</a>. 
    Currently, only Google Chrome can establish the data channels between browsers 
    that P relies on.
  </p>

  <p>
    <a href="https://github.com/oztu/onramp">onramp</a>, a simple WebSocket server, 
    is used as the signaling channel to establish initial connections.
